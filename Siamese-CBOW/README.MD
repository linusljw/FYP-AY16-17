This folder contains the Siamese-CBOW model used to train word embeddings for sentence representations. 

The format of the input data used for the model was the Toronto Bookcorpus under the torontobookcorpusutils folder. The methods/functions used to preprocess the training data can all be found in that folder. 

The siamese-cbow.py python file is used to train the model and the wordEmbeddings python file is used to retrieve the word embeddings from said model. Modifications have been made to the wordEmbeddings file.
